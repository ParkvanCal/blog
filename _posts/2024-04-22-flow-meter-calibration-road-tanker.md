🚛 *Flow Meter Fabrication and Calibration Project Progression*

Flow meter calibration plays a critical role in ensuring accurate measurement of fuel transferred via road tankers. Here's how Parkvan Calibration delivers precision and trust, step by step.

---

⚙️ Stage 1: Flow Meter Fabrication

We begin by selecting materials and engineering specifications aligned with the required throughput and fuel type.

- Material selection (stainless steel, aluminum)
- Metering mechanism: turbine or positive displacement
- Customization based on tanker layout

---

🔩 Stage 2: Mounting and Pipe Fittings on Road Tanker

Secure integration onto the tanker chassis is essential for durability and performance.

- Isolation valves installation
- Pipe routing to minimize turbulence
- Safety features (non-return valves, pressure relief)

---

🎯 Stage 3: Field Calibration and Accuracy Testing

We calibrate against a *master meter* or *prover tank* in compliance with ZIMTRADE and trade measures standards.
